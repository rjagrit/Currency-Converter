**Currency Converter**
This project is a simple and interactive currency converter built with JavaScript. It allows users to select a source currency and a target currency from dropdown menus populated dynamically with currency codes. Users can input an amount, and the app fetches real-time exchange rates using a free public API (Fawaz Ahmedâ€™s Currency API) to convert the amount from the source to the target currency.

The app also displays the corresponding country flags for the selected currencies for better user experience. It handles invalid inputs by defaulting to a minimum amount of 1 and displays error messages when exchange rates are unavailable. The UI updates automatically on page load and user interactions, providing seamless and accurate currency conversions.
